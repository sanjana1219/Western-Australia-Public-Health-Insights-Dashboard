Western Australia Public Health Insights Dashboard   This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and visualize public health trends in Western Australia using real-world government data sourced from data.gov.au.The dashboard supports data-driven decision-making for healthcare planning, policy formulation, and public health research.

Project Overview


The dashboard focuses on key public health indicators, including:

Potentially Preventable Hospitalizations (PPH)

Low Birth Weight trends
Alcohol-related health risks
Cancer incidence patterns
Fertility rates and stillbirth percentages
Injury and poisoning contributions
Age-Standardized Birth Rates (ASBR)
Population and demographic insights


Tools & Technologies

Microsoft SQL Server – Data storage, cleaning, and preprocessing
Power BI – Data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Advanced measures and trend analysis

Key Features

Interactive slicers for Region and Year
Advanced visualizations including donut charts, line charts, waterfall charts, decomposition trees, and KPI cards
Dynamic trend analysis using custom DAX measures
Clear representation of regional disparities and temporal changes in health indicators

Purpose & Impact

This dashboard demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can be effectively combined to transform complex public health data into meaningful insights. It highlights improvements in maternal health and injury reduction while identifying ongoing challenges such as alcohol-related harm and regional health inequalities.
